# One-Hundred-Memories
History Should not be forgotten. 
It is all around us.
On December 13, 1937, Nanjing sank in a sea of blood.
On December 13, 2014, the first "National Memorial Day for the Victims of the Nanjing Massacre" was established.
If you are in Nanjing, 
from Qixia to Xuanwu, from Qinhuai to Jiangning, 
from Pukou to Drum Tower, from Jianye to Yuhuatai, 
from Qixia Temple to Zhongshan Scenic Area, 
from Nanjing University to Wutaishan Sports Center, 
in these places, you can find the memory of the Nanjing Massacre.

The map collected one hundred memory points of this historic catastrophe in Nanjing City. We should not forget the grief, horror, and loss. We pray for peace and love forever.
